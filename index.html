    <h1>Georgia Trip</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, this page describes my trip to Georgia (the country) in September
      2021. I hope you enjoy!
    </p>
    <h2>Quick Background</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in the United States, but I lived in Georgia from the time I
      was 3 months old until the age of 6. Since coming to the states from May
      2005, I have been going back to Georgia from time to time - the first in
      the summer of 2008 (overlapping the period of the brief war with Russia),
      and the summer of 2014.
